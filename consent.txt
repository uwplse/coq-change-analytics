DATA POLICY
-------------

By participating in this study, you consent to the following data policy:
The plugin will collect data on the changes (code executed in Coq, 
along with the time at which the code was executed)
that you make while developing proofs during the data collection period of 
August 7th through September 7th. During registration, the plugin will also 
collect and store information on your level of experience
in Coq, the purpose for which and frequency with which you use Coq, and
about your development processes and environment. This information will be stored
with a unique identifier, and the unique identifier will be linked to the
collected data as well. The server will collect IP addresses;
the IP addresses will not be stored with the resulting data.

The collected data (unique identifiers, code changes, and answers to registration
questions) will be used to guide the development of a proof patching tool
and of a machine learning tool. The data will also be used in a publication,
and it will be publicly available for use by other researchers.
There will be no identifiable links between personally identifiable information
and the data in any publications, or in the publicly available dataset.
