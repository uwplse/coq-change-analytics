There will be a consent form here, which the plugin will ask you to consent to.
It will say all of these things nicely:

* I'm over 18
* I'm fluent in English
* I have been using Coq for at least a year
* My answers to the profile questions are honest
* If I did Alpha/Beta, I've removed my .analytics_profile before starting
* I won't spoof other users

Then also, a summary of the data collected and how it will be used.
Based on the IRB:
For both rounds of data collection, we will collect the changes (code executed in the proof assistant, along with the
time at which the code was executed) that programmers make while developing proofs of program correctness
while the tool is running. For the registration questions, we will also collect information on the level of experience
the programmer has using the proof assistant, the purpose for which and frequency with which the programmer
uses the proof assistant, and about the programmer's development processes and environment. This information
will be stored with a unique identifier for each programmer that the tool generates.

There will be no identifiable links between personally
identifiable information and the data in any publications. We will also be collecting code changes that
participants make, and the server will collect IP addresses. The IP addresses will not be stored with the resulting
data, and we will obtain consent from participants to sharing code changes.
The dataset will be released etc. and used etc. for stuff.

Then:
 
* I have read the consent form [y/n]
* I understand and agree to all of the above [y/n]
* I consent to participate in this study [y/n]
